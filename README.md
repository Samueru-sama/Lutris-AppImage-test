# Lutris AppImage

These are unofficial AppImage builds of [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) that any distribution can run. Currently we're only following stable builds and only support x86_64.

These builds also bundle some i386 packages and the latest Wine as certain packages are necessary for Lutris' version of Wine-GE to run. Also it's kinda for convenience as the latest version of Wine-GE is a bit old.
